  <Verse1>Oh to see the dawn
of the darkest day
Christ on the road to Calvary
Tried by sinful men 
torn and beaten then
Nailed to a cross of wood</Verse1>
  <Verse2>Oh to see the pain 
written on Your face
Bearing the awesome weight
 of sin
Ev'ry bitter thought ev'ry 
evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained
 brow</Verse2>
  <Verse3>Now the daylight flees
now the ground beneath
Quakes as its Maker bows
 His head

Curtain torn in two dead 
are raised to life
Finished the vict'ry cry</Verse3>
  <Verse4>Oh to see my name 
written in the wounds
For through Your suff'ring
 I am free

Death is crushed to death 
life is mine to live
Won through Your selfless love</Verse4>
  <Chorus1>This the pow'r of the cross
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross</Chorus1>
  <Chorus2>This the pow'r of the cross
Son of God slain for us
What a love what a cost
We stand forgiven at the cross</Chorus2>
