  <Verse1>
I will enter His gates 
with thanksgiving in my heart,
I will enter His courts with praise;
I will say this is the day
that the Lord has made,
I will rejoice for 
He has made me glad.

He has made me glad, 
He has made me glad;
I will rejoice for 
He has made me glad.
He has made me glad, 
He has made me glad;


I will rejoice for 
He has made me glad.</Verse1>
  <Chorus1>I will rejoice for 
He has made me glad.
He has made me glad, 
He has made me glad;
I will rejoice for 
He has made me glad.
He has made me glad, 
He has made me glad;
I will rejoice for
 He has made me glad.</Chorus1>
