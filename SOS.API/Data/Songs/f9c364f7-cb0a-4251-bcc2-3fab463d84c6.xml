  <Verse1>Jesus Christ I think
upon Your sacrifice
You became nothing
poured out to death
Many times I've wondered
at Your gift of life
And I'm in that
place once again
I'm in that
place once again</Verse1>
  <Verse2>Now You are exalted
to the highest place
King of the heavens
where one day I'll bow
But for now I marvel
at this saving grace
And I'm full of
praise once again
I'm full of
praise once again</Verse2>
  <Chorus1>And once again I look upon
the cross where You died
I'm humbled by Your mercy
and I'm broken inside
Once again I thank You
Once again I pour
out my life</Chorus1>
  <Bridge1>Thank You for the cross
Thank You for the cross
Thank You for the cross
My friend</Bridge1>
