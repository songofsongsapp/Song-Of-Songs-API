  <Verse1>I will offer up my life
In spirit and truth
Pouring out the oil of love
As my worship to You
In surrender I must give
My every part
Lord receive the sacrifice
Of a broken heart</Verse1>
  <Verse2>You deserve my
Every breath
For You've paid
The great cost
Giving up Your life to death
Even death on a cross
You took all my
Shame away
There defeated
My sin
Opened up the
Gates of heaven
And have beckoned me in</Verse2>
  <Chorus1>Jesus what can I give
What can I bring
To so a faithful a friend
To so loving a King
Saviour what can be said
What can be sung
As a praise of Your name

For the things
You have done
O my words could not tell
Not even in part
Of the debt of love
That is owed
By this thankful heart</Chorus1>
  <Tag1>What can I give
What can I bring
What can I sing
As an offering Lord</Tag1>
